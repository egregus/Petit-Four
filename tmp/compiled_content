				I am in no capacity to lie about any of tha~t! Utmost, it must be clear, 
				without even a rrrresidual doubt about, something plainly, indubitably,

			%h3 I went to a marvelous party!
			%h3
				Where on the occasion, I took on a date six scrrrrumptious cakes out for some
				dinner and wine. We galavanted through the strrrreets and boy! did we have a big time.
				Now I see you make a serious inquire about how in the hell six fluffy desserts conspire
				to bring in a lad. It's all very sad, you say, to see such glee sprrrring
				unnaturally. But nevermind. 
			%h3	
				Weary though your queary is, I dare to tell you more, that by the last delight of light our
				skin was moored at every pore of wine, sweat, blood (of every form), and the after-glow of frrrrivolous
				elation. I remember nothing from then on, so the rrrrest is left to speculation.
			%h3	
				Now I know the lack of gore is such a bore but listen here. I have not much time 
				to explain what happened to my little Mouseketeers. To refuse to keep quiet on 
				the pruriently private, is foolish, ghoulish and dare I say obtuse 
			%h3 ... what I can say is ...
			%h3
				though the atmosphere was rather queer and the wine corks very loose, one thing here is awfully clear, 
				tha~t! you can be sure: I went to a marvelous party and I couldn't have liked it more!
